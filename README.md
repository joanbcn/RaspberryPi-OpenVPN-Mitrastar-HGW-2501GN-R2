# RaspberryPi-OpenVPN-Mitrastar-HGW-2501GN-R2
Trying to install OpenVPN on my Raspberry Pi connected to my spanish Movistar Mitrastar HGW-2501GN-R2 router. 
Following some internet videos I am trying to install OpenVpn in the Raspberry Pi so I can share a my internet conection with some chinese friends, who can acces the free uncensored internet we enjoy. 
First I have to open a port in my router, I understood so, so I can configure a static IP. Still no success.
